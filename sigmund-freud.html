His theories on child sexuality, libido and the ego, among other topics, were some of the most influential academic concepts of the 20th century.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life, Education and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Freud was born in the Austrian town of Freiberg, now known as the Czech Republic, on May 6, 1856. When he was four years old, Freud’s family moved to Vienna, the town where he would live and work for most of the remainder of his life. He received his medical degree in 1881. As a medical student and young researcher, Freud’s research focused on neurobiology, exploring the biology of brains and nervous tissue of humans and animals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduation, Freud promptly set up a private practice and began treating various psychological disorders. Considering himself first and foremost a scientist, rather than a doctor, he endeavored to understand the journey of human knowledge and experience.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Early in his career, Freud became greatly influenced by the work of his friend and Viennese colleague, Josef Breuer, who had discovered that when he encouraged a hysterical patient to talk uninhibitedly about the earliest occurrences of the symptoms, the symptoms sometimes gradually abated.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After much work together, Breuer ended the relationship, feeling that Freud placed too much emphasis on the sexual origins of a patient's neuroses and was completely unwilling to consider other viewpoints. Meanwhile, Freud continued to refine his own argument.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Theories</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Freud's psychoanalytic theory, inspired by his colleague Josef Breuer, posited that neuroses had their origins in deeply traumatic experiences that had occurred in the patient's past. He believed that the original occurrences had been forgotten and hidden from consciousness. His treatment was to empower his patients to recall the experience and bring it to consciousness, and in doing so, confront it both intellectually and emotionally. He believed one could then discharge it and rid oneself of the neurotic symptoms. Some of Freud’s most discussed theories included:</p><ul data-node-id=11 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Id, ego and superego: These are the three essential parts of the human personality. The id is the primitive, impulsive and irrational unconscious that operates solely on the outcome of pleasure or pain and is responsible for instincts to sex and aggression. The ego is the “I” people perceive that evaluates the outside physical and social world and makes plans accordingly. And the superego is the moral voice and conscience that guides the ego; violating it results in feelings of guilt and anxiety. Freud believed the superego was mostly formed within the first five years of life based on the moral standards of a person’s parents; it continued to be influenced into adolescence by other role models.</li><li>Psychic energy: Freud postulated that the id was the basic source of psychic energy or the force that drives all mental processes. In particular, he believed that libido, or sexual urges, was a psychic energy that drives all human actions; the libido was countered by Thanatos, the death instinct that drives destructive behavior.</li><li>Oedipus complex: Between the ages of three and five, Freud suggested that as a normal part of the development process all kids are sexually attracted to the parent of the opposite sex and in competition with the parent of the same sex. The theory is named after the Greek legend of Oedipus, who killed his father so he could marry his mother.</li><li>Dream analysis: In his book The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud believed that people dreamed for a reason: to cope with problems the mind is struggling with subconsciously and can’t deal with consciously. Dreams were fueled by a person’s wishes. Freud believed that by analyzing our dreams and memories, we can understand them, which can subconsciously influence our current behavior and feelings.</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Freud’s theories were no doubt influenced by other scientific discoveries of his day. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://tempest.saymedia.com/people/charles-darwin-9266433 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Charles Darwin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Charles Darwin</a>'s understanding of humankind as a progressive element of the animal kingdom certainly informed Freud's investigation of human behavior. Additionally, the formulation of a new principle by scientist Hermann von Helmholtz, stating that energy in any given physical system is always constant, informed Freud's scientific inquiries into the human mind. Freud's work has been both rapturously praised and hotly critiqued, but no one has influenced the science of psychology as intensely as Sigmund Freud.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The great reverence that was later given to Freud's theories was not in evidence for some years. Most of his contemporaries felt that his emphasis on sexuality was either scandalous or overplayed. In 1909, he was invited to give a series of lectures in the United States; it was only after the ensuing publication of his book Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis (1916) that his fame grew exponentially.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Books</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Freud has published a number of important works on psychoanalysis. Some of the most influential include:</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Studies in Hysteria' (1895)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Freud and Breuer published their theories and findings in this book, which discussed their theories that by confronting trauma from a patient’s past, a psychoanalyst can help a patient rid him or herself of neuroses.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Interpretation of Dreams' (1900)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1900, after a serious period of self-analysis, Freud published what has become his most important and defining work, which posits that dream analysis can give insight into the workings of the unconscious mind. The book was and remains controversial, producing such topics as the Oedipus complex. Many psychologists say this work gave birth to modern scientific thinking about the mind and the fields of psychology, psychiatry and psychoanalysis.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Psychopathology of Everyday Life' (1901)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This book gave birth to the so-called “Freudian slip” — the psychological meaning behind the misuse of words in everyday writing and speech and the forgetting of names and words. These slips, he explained through a series of examples, revealed our inner desires, anxieties and fantasies.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality' (1905)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While no one person will die without sex, the whole of humanity would without it — so sex drives human instincts, Freud believed. In this work, he explores sexual development and the relationship between sex and social behavior without applying his controversial Oedipal complex.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Wife and Kids</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1882, Freud became engaged to marry Martha Bernays. The couple had six children — the youngest of whom, Anna Freud, went on to become a distinguished psychoanalyst herself.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Freud fled Austria to escape the Nazis in 1938 and died in England on September 23, 1939, at age 83 by suicide. He had requested a lethal dose of morphine from his doctor, following a long and painful battle with oral cancer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.historyvault.com/collections/biography?cmpid=HV_Sigmund_Freud" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='Watch "Sigmund Freud: Analysis of a Mind" on HISTORY Vault' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Watch "Sigmund Freud: Analysis of a Mind" on HISTORY Vault</a></strong></p><img alt="Edgar Allan Poe" title="Edgar Allan Poe" width=700 height=200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/editorial-promo-700x200-svod-hvault-topics-biography.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><ul data-node-id=34 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Sigmund Freud</li><li>Birth Year: 1856</li><li>Birth date: May 6, 1856</li><li>Birth City: Freiberg, Moravia, Austrian Empire</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Sigmund Freud was an Austrian neurologist best known for developing the theories and techniques of psychoanalysis.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Writing and Publishing</li><li>World War II</li><li>Education and Academia</li><li>Science and Medicine</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Taurus</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>University of Vienna</li></ul><li>Nacionalities</li><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Freud's book, 'The Interpretation of Dreams,' is said to have given birth to modern scientific thinking about the mind and the fields of psychology, psychiatry and psychoanalysis.</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1939</li><li>Death date: September 23, 1939</li><li>Death City: London</li><li>Death Country: England</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=37><ul data-node-id=39 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Sigmund Freud Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/scientists/sigmund-freud</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E;
