Her place of birth is Denmark, which makes her Danish by nationality, but her ethnic background is mixed.</p><p>Though the Danish is part of the glittering world of showbiz, she has managed to shield her family members from public scrutiny; thus, no one knows who her parents are, and it is not also known if she has siblings or grew up as an only child.</p><h2><strong>Is Mette-Marie Kongsved Married to Elijah Wood?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/84756522_198488094544600_4001699669398702910_n-2-e1671395382617.jpg><p>No, Mette-Marie Kongsved is not the wife of Elijah Wood. According to reports, the celebrity duo first crossed paths while working on the set of I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore in 2016. Elijah is an American actor and movie producer best known for his role in The Lord of the Rings.</p><p>The couple managed to keep their dalliance under wraps for a while until they were spotted in Pasadena, CA, holding hands around January 2018. It was at this point that they decided to go public with their relationship. Their next public appearance was witnessed in February 2019 when they graced the Rodarte fall-winter fashion show as a couple.</p><h3><strong>Mette-Marie Kongsved and Elijah Wood Once Sparked Engagement Rumors</strong></h3><p>Mette-Marie Kongsved was already expecting a baby in July 2019 when the movie producer and her love interest were spotted on the streets of LA going about their business. Fans didn’t not only notice her baby bump, they equally took note of the engagement ring she brandished on her ring finger.</p><p>Needless to say, the media sources went into a reporting frenzy as many of them concluded that the celebrity duo had become officially engaged. However, three long years have passed, and neither Elijah nor Kongsved deemed it necessary to confirm or refute the claims. Besides, Elijah was in an interview session during the later part of 2019 when he acknowledged Mette-Marie as his girlfriend and not fiancée.</p><p>It must be noted that the fact that Elijah and Kongsved seem not to be moving toward marriage does not mean that the movie actor is not interested in matrimony. After he broke up with Pamela Racine, he claimed to be interested in getting married and raising his own family in a December 2011 interview session with ContactMusic.com.</p><p>According to Elijah, most of his friends already have their own families, and he is looking forward to building his own, but there are things that must be in place first.</p><h3><strong>The Celebrity Couple&nbsp; Share One Child</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/101309854_1194519697566892_9071899811599335272_n-1-e1671395528842.jpg><p>Elijah Wood and Mette-Marie Kongsved have lasted for six years, and their dalliance has birthed one child. According to what Elijah said on the set of Late Night With Seth Meyers, it was on Christmas eve of 2018 that they learned that Kongsved had conceived. The Lord of the Rings” actor said he decided to change his ways on the spot and has never smoked again since then.</p><p>The celebrity duo <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">welcomed their bundle of joy</a>, Evan Kongsved-Wood, in 2019. The proud mum and dad made a conscious effort to keep their baby shielded from public scrutiny; they only revealed his face in 2020 while on a walk with Elijah’s co-star in Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan. The baby is currently 4 years old.</p><h2><strong>What Does Mette-Marie Kongsved Do For A Living?</strong></h2><p>Kongsved was barely 21 when she started working in a professional capacity as a production assistant, debuting as part of the production crew of the film Between Us with a-listers such as Julia Stiles, Melissa George, and Taye Diggs.</p><p>Switching from production to costuming, Mette-Marie Kongsved worked with the costume crew of the movie, A Yellow Ribbon, including other productions like Cheap Thrills, ABCs of Death 2, The Raid 2, Mandy, and Apostle, where she took charge of designing their costumes.</p><h3><strong>She Debuted as a Producer in 2017</strong></h3><p>The film entitled “I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore” marked Kongsved’s debut as a full-fledged movie producer in 2017. Important to note that her love interest, actor and movie producer Elijah Wood starred in the production as Tony.</p><p>Her next movie production gig was achieved a couple of years later when she produced two additional films, Come to Daddy and Get Dukes! To date, Mette-Marie Kongsved’s most notable production effort is recorded on the set of the fantasy drama movie, Nine Days in 2020.</p><p>The Edson Oda-created production was shot in less than one month in Utah in the United States. It has some of the best of Hollywood on set, including Winston Duke, who played the lead character of Will, Zazie Beets, who portrayed the role of Emma, Benedict Wong, who brought the character of Kyo to life, and Tony Hale came in as Alexander.</p><p>Despite the then-ravaging Corona Virus pandemic, the producers of the movie made it to the 27th January 2020 Sundance Film Festival, where it premiered.</p><p>Due to the pandemic, the release of the movie was done systematically in select theaters.<br>Other projects that come under Kongsved’s movie production portfolio include Boyz in the Wood, and 2021’s I Blame Society. The Denmark native has also made her contribution to the music industry, working for Sia’s Cheap Thrills as a music supervisor.</p><h3><strong>Mette-Marie Kongsved is a Shrewd Businesswoman</strong></h3><p>Kongsved became a businesswoman in 2018 after she emerged as a co-founder of the production firm, Nowhere. The movie producer joined efforts with two of her colleagues, Laura Tunstall and Michelle Craig, to achieve this feat. The main purpose of establishing Nowhere is to identify bold new creators and support their projects.</p><p>The movie production firm has existed for four years and has recorded an admirable level of success. It has done some excellent partnership with Michelle Craig and Piero Frescobaldi and their famed creative production studio known as Unit9.</p><p>The projects that Nowhere has executed so far include Nine Days, Get Duked!, I Blame Society and Come To Daddy, where Kongsved’s boyfriend, Elijah, also worked.</p><h3><strong>Who Was Mette-Maried Kongsved’s First Husband?</strong></h3><p>Mette-Maried Kongsved was the wife of movie producer, director, and screenwriter, Evan Louis Katz. Evan is an alum of the Orlando-based Full Sail Film School and gained popularity for projects like Home Sick, Cheap Thrills, Pop Skull, and more.</p><p>The duo tied the knot on the 15th of May 2011, but Evans filed for a divorce on the 12th of June 2016 after five years together. The couple never disclosed what led to their divorce, but fans were speculating that Kongsved was already dating Elijah while still married, and that may have been the reason for their split. The couple’s divorce was finalized on the 12th of January, 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmpJ6spJp6rq3Ropxmo5%2BjtLTCxJ1kraCVYrqwwMeeqWanlmKyrbXJmp9mr5%2BksbR50qilaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-mette-marie-kongsved-the-mother-of-elijah-woods-son.html&text=Meet%20Mette-Marie%20Kongsved%2c%20The%20Mother%20of%20Elijah%20Wood%27s%20Son&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-mette-marie-kongsved-the-mother-of-elijah-woods-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-mette-marie-kongsved-the-mother-of-elijah-woods-son.html&title=Meet%20Mette-Marie%20Kongsved%2c%20The%20Mother%20of%20Elijah%20Wood%27s%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-mette-marie-kongsved-the-mother-of-elijah-woods-son.html&title=Meet%20Mette-Marie%20Kongsved%2c%20The%20Mother%20of%20Elijah%20Wood%27s%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-mette-marie-kongsved-the-mother-of-elijah-woods-son.html&title=Meet%20Mette-Marie%20Kongsved%2c%20The%20Mother%20of%20Elijah%20Wood%27s%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-mette-marie-kongsved-the-mother-of-elijah-woods-son.html&description=Meet%20Mette-Marie%20Kongsved%2c%20The%20Mother%20of%20Elijah%20Wood%27s%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./recorder-the-marion-stokes-project-movie-review-2019.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project movie review (2019)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jared-joseph-powell-mugshot-photo-arrest-charges.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jared Joseph Powell Mugshot Photo: Arrest And Charges">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
